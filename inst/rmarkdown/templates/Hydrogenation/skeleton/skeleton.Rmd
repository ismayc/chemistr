## Abstract

A brief description of the purpose, procedure, and conclusions.

## Calculations

Insert a figure (scan) of your calculations from your notebook.  To insert a figure, with a caption see the iron analysis lab or see: <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html>

The calculations to include are:

1. Percentage of each fatty acid
2. Total Mass of each triglyceride
3. Molar Mass of each triglyceride
4. Moles of each triglyceride
5. Moles C=C double bonds
6. Moles H2
7. Conversion from moles H2 to L
8. % Efficiency Calculations
9. Average (if using a program, write what program was used); If using R to calculate see: http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/numerical-measures/mean
10. Standard Deviation (if using a program, write what program was used); If using R to calculate see: http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/numerical-measures/standard-deviation
9.  95% Confidence Interval


## Results

Text that describes both your observations as well as commentary on your GC/FAME results and your hydrogenation results.  Look at Iron_Analysis markdown file on how to include a picture with a caption in your report, the figure should be of your FAME chromatogram.  

## Discussion

Analysis of your results.  See page 9.10 in your lab manual for more detailed information on what this section should include.

FYI:  There is a built in spell check for your R markdown file under the Edit menu in RStudio.  Please do that before Knitting :)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here is where you input your GC data.
FAME <- c("16:0", "18:0", "18:1", "18:2", "18:3")
Rt <- c(4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
ID <-c("Acid A", "Acid B", "Acid C", "Acid D", "Acid E")
Area <- c(100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
MassPer <- c(7, 13, 20, 27, 33)
ClassAverage <- c("10+/-1", "20 +/- 1", "30 +/- 1", "40 +/- 1", "50 +/- 1")
LitValue <- c("7.9-10.2", "4.8-6.1", "35.9-42.3", "41.5-47.9", "0.3-0.4")
# Place the columns next to each other in a data frame
Green <- data.frame(FAME, ID, Rt, Area, MassPer, ClassAverage, LitValue)
Green <- rename(Green,
                "FAME Label" = FAME, 
                "Rt Label (units)" = Rt, 
                "ID Label" = ID, 
                "Area Label (units)" = Area, 
                "Mass Percent Label" = MassPer,
                "ClassAverage +/- 95% CI (units)" = ClassAverage, 
                "Published Mass Percent" = LitValue)
```

```{r nice_table1, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
#Here is where you create a table of your GC data along with class data from the analysis of the spreadsheet and literature data obtained from Moodle.  Nothing needs to be done in this section except adding the caption in line 87.  The rest is using the data that you inputed in the previous chunk (lines 67-80).
chem_table(Green, caption = "Insert caption")
```
