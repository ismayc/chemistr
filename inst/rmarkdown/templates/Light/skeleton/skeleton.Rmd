## Q1: What colors are found in a white light source?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here is where you input your data for the white light source
Color <- c() #These colors need to be surrounded by parenthesis ""
WavelengthRange <- c()
Q1_data <- data_frame(Color, WavelengthRange)
```

```{r table, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
# Here is the code for creating a table
chem_table(Q1_data, caption = "A lovely caption for the table")
```


## Q2:  Does water absorb visible light? Maybe?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Absorbance spectrum of $H_{2}O$ in a 1-cm cuvette."}
include_graphics("name of figure in directory")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Transmittance spectrum of $H_{2}O$ in a 1-cm cuvette."}
include_graphics("name of figure in directory")
```


Answer to question should include:

1. Take-home message

2. Supporting data from figures and/or observations

3.  Any problems or another way to interpet the data

Example

Water molecules do not interact with water.  This is based upon the fact that white light that transmits through the water still appears white to my eyes.  Also, the absorbance spectrum (figure 1) shows negligible amount of absorbance throughout the entire visible range and the transmittance spectrum (figure 2) shows almost 100% transmittance from 400-700 nm.  However there is always the possibility that the instrument I am using is not sensitive enough to detect a small change in absorbance or transmittance due to the water.



## Q3:  How can the color of $NiSO_{4}(aq)$ be explained?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Absorbance spectrum of 1 M $Ni(SO_{4})$ in a 1-cm cuvette."}
include_graphics("name of figure in directory")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Transmittance spectrum of 1 M $Ni(SO_{4})$ in a 1-cm cuvette."}
include_graphics("name of figure in directory")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Absorbance spectrum of 1M $NaSO_{4}$ in a 1-cm cuvette."}
include_graphics("name of figure in directory")
```

Answer to question using the same guidelines as above.
