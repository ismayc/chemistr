## Results


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Here is the chunk in which you will input all of your raw data and also do the mathematical analysis to get the GAWs of Mg for eacho f your trials.

Trial <- c() #To make a nice table we want to number our trials
Mass <- c() #This is the mass of the metal in grams.  Include all sig figs
VolumeH2 <- c() #This is the volume of H2 collected in mL.  Include all sig figs
Temp <- c() #This is the temperature recorded in Celcius
Patm <- c() #This is the pressure in the room in units of mm Hg
Pvap <- c() #This is the vapor pressure of water in kPa
PH2 <- #Here is where you write the math to calculate partial pressure H2 in units of atm
nH2 <- #Here is where you write the math to calculate moles of H2 from all the other data 
GAW <- #Here is where you will write the math to calculate the GAW of Mg for each trial in g/mol
GAWs <- data_frame(Trial, Mass, VolumeH2, GAW) #Here are the items you want to include in Table 1
```

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}

# Below you create a table for your data frame created above.  Make sure that after you knit your report to word, you go back to this table and fix the column headings to better represent the columns and include units in the column headings.  You should also look at the numbers in the table and be certain they correctly represent the correct number of sig figs.

chem_table(GAWs, caption = "Table 1: A lovely caption for the table") #Here is the creation of table 1



```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Here is where you will use the code used previously to calculate the average and 95% confidence interval for the GAW of Mg from your data.

In a single paragraph summarize the results of this experiment. See Instructions for details.

## Discussion

In a single well-formulated paragraph report your results along with an analysis of the errors in the experiment.  See Instructions for details. 

## References

Include the reference for your GAW of Mg.


## Calculations Appendix

Include a picture of your calucations for the GAW of Trial 1.  Make sure they are easy to read and include all units and conversion factors.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
