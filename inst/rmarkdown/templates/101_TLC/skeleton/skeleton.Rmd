```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure Caption Goes Here"}
#Take a picture of your UV illuminated TLC plates. For the caption look at the literaure figure in the instructions.  Use that as a template for writing a good caption. 

#Note, you will need to copy and past one copy of this chunk into your final lab report for each person in your group.

#TLC Control Plate

#TLC Experimental Plate
include_graphics("Image name") #Between the quotes, type the name of your image file EXACTLY as it appears in the file you uploaded.

##Discussion

Delete this information before handing in the assignment:
Here is where you will input your discussion for this lab. The discussion should be a well-organized paragraph (or two). Do not just answer the statements below as separate points.  The things that should be part of your written discussion are:
1.  Restate the purpose and the hypothesis of the experiment.
2.  State the conclusion (claim) you can make about the condtions in which ATP is or is not stable.	
3.  Describe the evidence that supports your conclusions.  Make sure you specifically point out anything that the reader must see in a figure or table that supports the conclusion.  References to the figures or tables are included parenthetically.  For example:  The average Rf for ATP on the control plates was 0.24 +/- 0.04 (Table 1).  However in all lanes in which an acid was added to the ATP mixture, there were no spots within this range (Figure 1 lane 2, Figure 2 lane 1-3).  Instead spots showed up within the uncertainty range of AMP, 0.4 +/- 0.1, (Table 1 and Figure 1 Lane 2), indicating that the ATP has degraded by loosing two phosphates and is now AMP.    
4.  Discuss the accuracy and precision of the experiment.  Make sure you talk about precision and accuracy in separate statements so it is clear what it is you are linking to precision and what you are linking to accuracy.
(Hint: Does your data support how companies, such as Sigma, tell you to store ATP https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/a6144pis.pdf?)
