# Here is where you create your first graph.  Notice that we are fitting the data to the line Y=mX+b.  Determine whether this data fits well to this line and comment on this in the caption.  In order to get the slope of your fit line, run this chunk.  The value given in the console from `summary()` on the fitted model gives the slope and intercept of the best fit line (m and b in the equation above) as well as the R-squared value. If this is a good model, include this slope and its meaning in the graph caption.

## Discussion

Here is where you will input your discussion for this lab. The discussion should be a well-organized paragraph (or two).  Please refer to the Beer's Law Experiment #2 for information on what to include in your discussion as well as an example discussion.
