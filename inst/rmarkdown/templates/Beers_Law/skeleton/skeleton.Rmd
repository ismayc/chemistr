In order to get the slope of your fit line, run this chunk.  The value given in the console from `coefficients()` on the fitted model gives the slope of the best fit line (m in the equation above). If this is a good model, include this slope and its meaning in the graph caption.

## Discussion

Here is where you will input your discussion for this lab. The discussion should be a well-organized paragraph (or two).  Please refer to the Beer's Law lab worksheet for information on what to include in your discussion.
