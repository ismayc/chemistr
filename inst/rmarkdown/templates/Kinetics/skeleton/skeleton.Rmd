##Results


```{r, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
#Create a table of the results for identifying the chemical species involved in the clock reaction.  Make sure that anything that is kept constant in all reactions is included in the caption.
Chemicals <- c("KI", "NaCl", "$KIO_3$", "$Na_2SO_4$", "$NaHSO_3$", "$I_2$") #Identity of chemicals combined
KI<- c("Clear", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear" )               #Observation after mixing
NaCl <- c("Clear", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear")
KIO3 <- c("Clear", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear","Blue", "Blue")
Na2SO4<- c("Clear", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear")
I2 <- c("Clear", "Clear", "Blue", "Clear", "Blue", "Blue")
T_1 <- data.frame(Chemicals, KI, NaCl, KIO3, Na2SO4, I2)
chem_table(T_1, caption="Table 1: Input Caption")
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Input Caption"}
#Input your data and create a graph to see the relationship between the concentration of one reactant and the time needed for the reaction to reach its endpoint.  Think about whether you want to include a straight line best fit or not.  Does the data fit a straight line model?  If it doesn't, what might be a better fit to the data.  What evidence do you have for your proposed fit?



```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Input Caption"}
#Repeat the graph creation for any other reagents that were analyzed by concentration.




```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Input Caption "}
#Create a graph that shows the relationship that temperature has on the reaction rate.   Make sure the caption includes anything that was kept constant, such as reaction concentrations, and also any information you have about the shape of the graph.  Does it follow a linear relationship?  Is it more logarithmic?  What evidence do you have for the proposed relationship? 


```


```{r, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
#Create a table to show evidence for the reliability of your clock (specifically looking at the precision and accuracy of the clock)



```


##Discussion

`r #Provide an evidence based discussion of your results.  The lab report should discuss the answers to the following questions as well as the evidence that supports these answers: 1.	What is the chemical reaction?  2.	How does concentration effect the chemical reaction? 3.	How does temperature effect the chemical reaction? 4.	How were all these factors put together to design a chemical clock?  A description of the clock design should be included. 5.	How successful was the designed clock. Was it accurate?  Was it precise?`
