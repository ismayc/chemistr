## Data

```{r}
#If you are inserting a csv file that was exported from the spectrophotometers, the following code may be of help to you (details are found in Appendix 9B).  You may also want to mathematically reconfigure the data so it is easier to graph.
T2 <- read.csv("~/CHEM102_Dcass/E9 Kinetics/TRIAL_2.CSV") #here is the code that reads the csv file.  You will need to change what is in quotes.
T2 <- subset(T2, Time.s. <= 300) #This code might be useful if you don't want to use all of the data.  In this code only the data which has time less than or equal to 300 seconds will be used.



```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
# Here is a R chunk where you may want to create a graph with your kinetics data.   
chem_scatter(data = T2, xvar = Time.s., yvar = Absorbance, xlab = "X label", ylab = "Y label") #This is the info for making the graph.  You will need to change your data and variables to reflect your naming system. Remember that it is automatically set up to include a fit line to the equation Y=mx+b.
fit1 <- lm(Absorbance ~ Time.s., data = T2)  #This is how we get the fit values out.  If you change the variables you're graphing, the same will need to be done here.
summary(fit1) #This will show the fit parameters in your document.  Delete this line if you don't want the rough table showing up in your final document.
```

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}

# If you want to include a data table in your report, you can use this chunk.  It may be modified to fit the data you want in your report.  Below is just an example, NOT necesssary.  Don't forget to modify the table headings and sig figs after knitting your document.

Order <- c(0, 1, 2)
Blue <- c(0.9977, 0.9997, 0.8253)
Bleach <- c(0.7653, 0.8882, 0.9999)
R_2 <- data.frame(Order, Blue, Bleach)

chem_table(R_2, caption = "Table 1: A lovely caption for the table") #Here is the creation of table 1


```

## Discussion

See information in E9 Instructions for what should be included in the discussion.

## References

Include any references used in writing your report.  See the CHEM101 library site for information on how to write the citation.


## Calculations Appendix

Include a picture of the calculations outlined in the Exp 9 instructions.  Make sure they are easy to read and include all units and conversion factors.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" "}
include_graphics("Title of Figure, example: Calc.pdf)
```
