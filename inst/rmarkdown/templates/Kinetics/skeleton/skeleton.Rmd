## Results and Discussion

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Input Caption"}

#Here is the chunk in which you will analyze the Part A data: determining the order in respect to iodide.


I <- c() #This is the concentrations of iodide in M
RateA <- c() #This is rate in Absorbance/sec
RateB <-  #Here we mathematically change the rate from Abs/sec to M/sec
LogI <-  #Here you mathematically change the [I-] to Log([I-])
LogRateB <- #Here you mathematically change the Rate to Log(Rate)  
I_Data <- data_frame(LogI, LogRateB) #Here are the items you want to graph

chem_scatter(data =I_Data, xvar = LogI, yvar = LogRateB, xlab = "Input",
     ylab = "Input")
fit1 <- lm( LogRateB ~ LogI)
Slope <-summary(fit1)$coef[1]
SE <-summary(fit1)$coef[2]
CI95_Slope <- qt(0.975,df=N-1)*SE

#By typing Slope or CI95_Slope into the console, you can determine what the slope +/-95% CI is and include it in the text and caption of your report.

# Here is the chunk in which you analyze the Part B Data: determining the order in respect to persulfate.  Use the above chunk as a guide for anlayzing this data.

```{r, echo=FALSE}

#Here is the chunk in which you calculate the k for each trial.
m <- #Based upon your data above, what is the stoichimetric number for m
n <-  #Based upon your data above, what is the stoichiometric number for n
k_PartA <- #Include the math that uses your experimentally determined rate law to caluclate k for each trial in Part A.  Hint:  you don't need to calculate each trial by hand.  Use the values above to do the calculations.
k_PartB <- #Include the math that uses your experimentally determined rate law to caluclate k for each trial in Part B.
ktotal <- c(k_PartA, k_PartB) #This combines the two vectors into one set of data
avek <- mean(ktotal) # our average k
Stdevk <- sd(ktotal) # our standard deviation of k
nk <- length(ktotal) # the number of k values 
CI95k <- qt(0.975,df=nk-1)*Stdevk/(sqrt(nk)) #calculation of 95% CI

#By typing avek or CI95k into the console, you can determine what the k +/-95% CI is and include it in the text of your report.

In the discussion paragraph(s) you should 1.  Restate the purpose.  2.  Describe (BRIEFLY) how the experiment was used to analyze the purpose.  3.  State the main take home message or result (Mechanism supported) and how your data supports this conclusion.  This should include direct parenthetical references to both figures.  4.  Report the Avg +/- 95% CI of k at 25 C (watch sig figs and units).  5.  Analyze the data for systematic error, explain how you came to your conclusion of whether there is or is not systematic error,  6.  Analyze the data for random error by reporting the % Relative Error for m, n, and k. 7.  If there is evidence of systematic error, then explain ONE source of systematic error.  Make sure in describing the source that you explain how it would effect the outcome. If there is no evidence of systematic error, then random error is your biggest issue (even if it too is small).  Then you should describe ONE (most likely largest) source of random error and how that source can be improved.  7.  Describe how you might expand upon this experiment (not redo it, but assuming this experiment worked what might the next step be?) 

## References

Include any relevant references.


## Calculations Appendix

Either include a figure from your notebook or type in a sample of the calculations done to determine:
1.  The concentration iodide (M)
2.  The concentration of persulfate (M)
3.  The rate in M/sec
4.  A sample calculation of k 

Make sure every calculation is present starting with your raw data.  The calculations should be clear, easy to follow, and includes units with all numbers.  Scan your calculations from your notebook. DO NOT use a camera to take a picture.  These pictures are much harder to read.

To insert a figure of your calculations you should use the code below and the figure should be saved in the same folder as your report file:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
include_graphics("Title of Figure, example: Calc.pdf)
```
