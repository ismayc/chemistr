```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(chemistr)
``` 




```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here is where you input your data for temperature (in ˚C) and volume (in mL). Do not include your lowest T data.
Temp.C <- c(27,41,51,55,61,66,76,80)
Vol.mL <- c(4.2,4.7,5.0,5.2,5.5,5.9,7.4,9.1)
N <- length(Temp.C)

# Now convert to Kelvin and Liters
Temp.K <- Temp.C + 273.15
Vol.L <- Vol.mL/1000

#Assume that the gas at your low temperature is all air, no water vapor. Calculate moles of air.
n.air <- 1.0*.0038/(0.08206*281) # n = PV/RT at your low temperature
  
#From the moles of air, calculate partial pressure of air at each temperature
P.air <- n.air*0.08206*Temp.K/Vol.L  # P = nRT/V
  
# Calculate partial pressure of water, P.water by subtracting P.air from P.atm
P.water <- 1.0 - P.air

# And now the data we need.
InvT <- 1/Temp.K # inverse temperature
lnP <- log(P.water) # natural logarithm of partial pressure of water
pdata <- data.frame(InvT,lnP) # create a dataframe

```

##Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Add caption"}

chem_scatter(data = pdata, xvar = InvT, yvar = lnP, xlab = "x label",
     ylab = "y label")
fit1 <- lm(lnP ~ InvT)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
Slope <-summary(fit1)$coef[2]
SE <-summary(fit1)$coef[4]
CI95_Slope <- qt(0.975,df=N-1)*SE


# calculate ∆Hvap and CI95 for ∆Hvap
Hvap <- -(0.0083145)*Slope # in kJ/mol
CI95_Hvap <- (0.0083145)*CI95_Slope 


Stats <-data_frame(Slope, CI95_Slope, Hvap, CI95_Hvap)

```

```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
Stats <-data_frame(Slope, CI95_Slope, Hvap, CI95_Hvap) #Here is a data frame of the statistical results.
chem_table(Stats, caption = "Table 1: A lovely caption for the table") #Here is the creation of table 1.  Don't forget to go back and change the values in word to the correct number of sig figs.
```

##Discussion

In the discussion include the following:
1.	Report the purpose of the experiment and the conclusion.  
2.	Mention and cite the data that supports this conclusion. 
3.	Report and cite the literature value for the heat of vaporization of water (specifying the source and the temperature at which it is given) and compare to your result. 
4.	In one or two sentences, discuss the impact of random and/or systematic error on your result.
