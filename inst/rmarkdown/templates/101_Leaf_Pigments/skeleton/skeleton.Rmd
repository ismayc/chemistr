## Experimental Methods
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Figure Caption"}
#To be completed individually. Upload a picture of either the treee or individual leaves that were used in the experiment.   
#In your caption be sure to identify the species of tree, the date, time, and location the leaves were obtained.

include_graphics("Name of Figure File") #Between the quotes, type the name of your image file EXACTLY as it appears in the file you uploaded.
```

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Figure Caption"}
#To be completed individually. Take a picture of your chromatogram(s).  Each person should have a chromatogram that represents the green leaf extract and the colored leaf extract.  Then upload it into the same folder that you saved your lab write-up.  This will allow you to use the included graphics function below.  
#In your caption be sure to identify who the chromatogram belongs to, the mobile phase and stationary phase used and the identity of the pigments.  See the lab instructions for an example photo and caption.

include_graphics("Name of Figure File") #Between the quotes, type the name of your image file EXACTLY as it appears in the file you uploaded.
```




```{r, echo=FALSE}
# To be completed individually.  Raw data input from your chromatograms.
#Note: If a pigment is missing a data point, then use "NA" in place of the value  

Pigment <- c("Anthocyanin", "Chlorophyll B", "Chlorophyll A", "Xanthophyll", "Carotenoid")
Rf_Green_Student1 <- c() #input the calculated Rf values from the Green leaf chromatogram
Rf_Colored_Student1 <- c() #input the calculated Rf values from the Colored leaf chromatogram

```


```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
#The rest of the report should be completed by your group
# Note: If a pigment is missing a data point in all figures due to the pigment not being present, then use "NA" in place of the value. 
Pigment <- c("Anthocyanin", "Chlorophyll B", "Chlorophyll A", "Xanthophyll", "Carotenoid")
Rf_Green_Average <- #Calculate the average Rf for all the pigments from the green leaves
Rf_Colored_Average <- #Calculate the average Rf for all the pigments from the colored leaves

Rf_Green <- data.frame(Pigment, Rf_Green_Student1, Rf_Green_Student2, Rf_Green_Student3, Rf_Green_Average)

Rf_Colored <- data.frame(Pigment, Rf_Colored_Student1, Rf_Colored_Student2, Rf_Colored_Student3, Rf_Green_Average)

chem_table(Rf_Green, caption = "Table 1: Insert caption") #Create a table of individual plus average green-leaf results

chem_table(Rf_Colored, caption = "Table 2: Insert caption") #Create a table of individual plus average colored-leaf results
```

```{r, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}


chem_table(Rf_Colored, caption = "Table 2: Insert caption") #Create a table of individual plus average colored-leaf results
```

##Discussion

Delete this information before handing in the assignment:
Here is where you will input your discussion for this lab. The discussion should be a well-organized paragraph (or two). Do not just answer the statements below as separate points.  The things that should be part of your written discussion are:
1.  Restate the purpose and the hypothesis of the experiment.
2.  State the conclusion (claim) can you make about the color change model.
3.  Explain how the evidence presented in the results section supports your claim.  
      *Make sure you specifically point out anything that the reader must see in a figure or table that supports the conclusion.  
      *References to the figures or tables must be included parenthetically.  For example:  The green leaves had all five pigments presented in each leaf species tested.  This is based upon matching colors (Figure 1, 3, and 5) and Rf values (Table 1).
4.  Discuss the ordering of the pigments in yuor chromatogram.  How does your identified order compare with your prediction in the pre-lab, based upon the figure you drew.  What does the order tell us about the polarity of the paper versus the polarity of the mobile phase?  Explain how the chemical structure of each pigment supports the order in which it separated.
5. Discuss the accuracy and precision of the experiment.  Make sure you talk about precision and accuracy in separate statements so it is clear what it is you are linking to precision and what you are linking to accuracy. Hint: Take a look at https://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/autumn-foliage-color for a great bibliography of papers for comparison.
