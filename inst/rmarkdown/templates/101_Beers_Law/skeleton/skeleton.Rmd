##DIY Spectrophotometer Setup

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure Caption"}
#Take a picture of your working spectrophotometer.  Then upload it into the same folder that you saved your lab write-up.  This will allow you to use the included graphics function below.  
#You can copy and paste this chunk for each person in your group.

include_graphics("Image name") #Between the quotes, type the name of your image file EXACTLY as it appears in the file you uploaded.
```

##Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Each person should individually complete this chunk.  Each individual chunk can then be copied and pasted into the combined group lab report to create the final report.
# Here is where you input your raw data from your experiment.

Concentration_Student1 <- c() #include the final concentration in your dilutions in units of Molarity.  
Blank_Student1 <- c()   
Water_Student1 <- c()
Blue_Student1 <- c()

#Look at how you completed the DIY Spectrophotometer lab and calculate the following variables
Transmittance_Water <-   #Transmittance of water sample
Transmittance_Blue <-   #Transmittance of blue food color sample 

Transmittance_Student1 <-  #Transmittance of Only blue sample with water removed.

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#From now on you will be looking at combined data.  To combine all of your data points into one data frame you must 
#1. Combine each person's variables into a single set of variables.  For example Transmittance_group <- c(Transmittance_Student1, Transmittance_Student2) 
#2. Create a data frame of the group Transmittance and Concentration variables.

Transmittance_group <- c()

Concentration_group <- c()

Group_data <- data.frame()

```




```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure Caption"}

#The first mathematical model you will test is the linear model.  In this case you can directly fit concentration versus transmittance to a straight line fit.

#To create the scatter plot, go to your linear regression lab report and copy and paste the code that will 1) create a scatter plot, using chem_scatter function 2) extract the fit data using the lm function and 3) provide a summary of the fit data using the summary function.

#Then change the code to represent the variables in Group_data

#Once you have run this chunk, write a caption.  In your caption include the color of film, size of cuvette, mathematical model you are testing and the details of the fit (slope +/- error and Y-intercept +/- error and R^2).  Watch your significant figures.










```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
#In this chunk you are going to test an exponential model (also called a semi-log plot).  To test an exponential model you need to create a scatter plot of the log10(Y) versus X.
#Just as in the previous chunk you will need to create a graph, extract the fit information and display a summary of it.
#Also, your caption should include the same things as the previous chunk.









```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
#In this chunk you are going to test a power model (also called a log-log plot).  To test a power model you need to create a scatter plot of the log10(Y) versus log10(X).
#Just as in the previous chunk you will need to create a graph, extract the fit information and display a summary of it.
#Also, your caption should include the same things as the previous chunk.

##Discussion

Delete this information before handing in the assignment:
Here is where you will input your discussion for this lab. The discussion should be a well-organized paragraph (or two). Do not just answer the statements below as separate points.  Please refer to the appendex in the instructions for an example lab report that includes a discussion.  The things that should be part of your written discussion are:
1.  Restate the purpose and the hypothesis of the experiment.
2.  State the conclusion (claim) can you make about the mathematical models that describe light and concentration?	
3.  Describe the evidence that supports your conclusions.  Make sure you specifically point out anything that the reader must see in a figure or table that supports the conclusion.  References to the figures or tables are included parenthetically.  For example:  A linear relationship was observed between apples and time (Figure 1), which is what would be predicted if the apple were eaten consistently over the course of a day.  More examples of this can be seen in Appendix 2B.
4.  The relationship between light transmittance and concentration is summarized in the Beer-Lambert Law.  Look up this equation and report it  (include a citation with your source).  How does it compare to your results?  Use your graphs to support your conclusion with data.
5.  Discuss the accuracy and precision of the experiment.  Make sure you talk about precision and accuracy in separate statements so it is clear what it is you are linking to precision and what you are linking to accuracy. Hint: Take a look at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed081p1475 for literature results to compare with for accuracy.
