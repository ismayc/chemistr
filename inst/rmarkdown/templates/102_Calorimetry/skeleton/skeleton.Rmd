###Calculations Appendix
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure Caption Goes Here"}
#Take a picture of the following calculations.  Make sure it is NEAT, legible and all units are included. See the Appendix 9A example.  Calculations should include: 1) Heat Capacity of Calorimeter, 2) Heat of Reaction for one salt trial. 3) Hot Pack calculations for total mass needed and total price for a pack. If no one in your group has good handwriting, then you are also welcome to type in the calculations but they should be jus as clear and easy to follow, with units.

include_graphics("Image name") #Between the quotes, type the name of your image file EXACTLY as it appears in the file you uploaded. To make this work, you must upload the picture into the same folder on RStudio that you saved this file into and it must be a jpeg or png file.  .heic files will not work.  If you have mutliple pictures, just copy and paste more of these functions.  If you are struggling to get this to work, the picture can be added to your knitted word document instead.
