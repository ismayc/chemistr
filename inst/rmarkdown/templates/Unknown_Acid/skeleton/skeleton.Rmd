##RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Here is the area where you will input your pH and volume data for your titration curve.
volume <- c()
volume <- #mathematically subtract your initial volume from all of your values, so that Vi = 0mL
ph <- c()
Total <- data.frame(volume, ph)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}

#Here is a plot of the titration curve and a plot of the first derivative of the data.
par(mfrow=c(1,2)) #This creates one figure with two plots side-by-side.  Therfore you only need to write a single caption that discusses both plots.

plot(Total$volume, Total$ph, xlab = "X axis label", ylab = "Y axis label") #Titration Curve plot.  This is similar to the chem_scatter function, but is set out as plot(xvariable, yvariable).

Deriv <- derivative(Total, plot=FALSE) #This is a function that will take the first derivative of the titration data by caluclating the slope between every two adjoining points.  Then it creates a new first_deriv data frame.

plot(Deriv$first_deriv$x1, Deriv$first_deriv$y1, type = "l", xlab = "X axis label", ylab = "Y axis label", xaxp = c(0, 33, 33)) #xaxp allows you to change the tick marks on the x axis.  This can be helpful for finding the exact volume with the highest first derivative value (slope from graph #1).  Currently the code says to make ticks from 0mL to 33mL with 33 tick marks.  This will create tick marks every 1 mL.

```

Include a discussion paragraph as outlined in Exp. 11 instructions.
