## Results and Discussion

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Input Caption that clearly identify the unknown number, equivalence point and the pKa of the unknown acid"}

#Here is the chunk in which you will input the data and graph your volume versus pH plot.  See many of the previous lab reports for the code to do this.



```

A well written paragraph that covers the following:

•Restate the purpose.  

•Describe (BRIEFLY) how the experiment was used to analyze the purpose.  Don’t describe the calculations.

•State the main take home message or result (MW and pKa of unknown acid) and how your data supports this conclusion.  

•Include direct parenthetical reference to figure 1.  

•Identify one concern or reservation you may have regarding your results.  (Please do not include "inexperience" as one such reservation.)


##Calculations Appendix

Either include a figure from your notebook or type in a sample of the calculations done to determine:

1.[NaOH] by standardization

2.Molecular Weight of unknown acid
