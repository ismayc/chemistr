## Calculations Appendix


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" "}
#Include the calculations from your notebook.  Make sure every calculation is present starting with your raw data.  The calculations should be clear, easy to follow, and includes units with all numbers.

#To insert a picture of your calculations you should use the code below and the figure should be saved in the same folder as your report file:

include_graphics("Calc.pdf")
