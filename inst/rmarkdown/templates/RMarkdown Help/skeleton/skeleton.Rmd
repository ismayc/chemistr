Files with the extension .rmd are known as R markdown files. These files combine the use of markdown, which can convert text into many different formats (html, pdf, Microsoft word, etc.), with the use of R code. This allows you to create documents with pretty text and data analysis all in one. This file will knit without errors and is a resource for you to see how  what is written in a .rmd translates when it is knit to a pdf.


In this document the white space contains markdown text while the gray boxes contain R code. In markdown text, spaces between words actually produce spaces. Here are some other examples of how to format your document.


##Example: Starting a New Paragraph


I want this to be in paragraph 1. 
I want this to be in paragraph 2.

vs

I want this to be in paragraph 1.

I want this to be in paragraph 2.

**By putting two line spaces in between text you can break the line.**

##Example: Bold and Italic Text

This is normal text


**This is bold text**


*This is italicized text*


##Example: Making Headers

#Header size 1

##Header size 2 

###Header size 3

####Header size 4 

##How to Add Links

In [] add the name for the link and in () add the URL for the link

##Example: How to Make Pretty Equations!

We can use Latex code in a markdown file to format equations by putting it in between two $ signs 

For an in line equation we can use $y = mx + b$

For an stand alone equation we want to be centered on the page we can use $$ y = mx + b $$

**Here are some common examples of equations you will use in chemistry.**

Beer's law is $A = a b c$ where A is the absorbance, $a$ is the molar absorbtivity in units of $M^{-1} cm^{-1}$ $b$ is the path length in $cm$, and $c$ is the concentration in $M$. 

**Conversions**

$P_{atm} = 29.83\: in\:  Hg\: * \frac{2.54\: cm}{1\: in} * \frac{1000\: mm}{1\: cm} * \frac{1\: atm}{760\: mm\: Hg}$

In equations to add spaces, $29.83 in Hg$ must be written as $29.83\: in \: Hg$.

**Supercript and Subscript**

$P_{atm}$ vs $P^{atm}$, the sub-scripted or super-scripted text must be written within the {}

$1.3 \times 10^{-3}$

$S_{2}O_{8}^{2-}$

**Fractions**

$\frac{a}{b}$  $\frac{1}{1000}$

You can also do sub scripts and super scripts within fractions...

$K_{a} = \frac{[A^{-}][H_{3}O^{+}]}{[HA]}$

**Commonly Used Symbols**

Degree Symbol: $^\circ$, e.g. 25 $^\circ$C

Delta Symbol: $\Delta$, e.g. $\Delta{A}$

Less Than/Greater Than: < / > , e.g. 10 < 30

Plus or Minus Sign: $\pm$, e.g. 5.0 $\pm$ 0.2

Percent Sign: %, e.g. 25 %

**More Example Equations**

$P = \frac{nRT}{V}$

$x = \sqrt{x^{2}}$

$rate = k[I^{-}]^{m}\,[S_{2}O_{8}^{2-}]^{n}$

Arrhenius Equation

$k = Ae^{-E_{a}/RT}$

**If you want to get fancy...you can also write reaction equations**

Mechanism A: 

$S_{2}O_{8}^{2-} \rightarrow SO_{4} + SO_{4}^{2-} \: (slow)$  

$SO_{4} + I^{-} \rightarrow SO_{4}^{2-} + I^{+}$

$I^{+} + I^{-} \rightarrow I_{2}$

$I_{2} + I^{-} \rightarrow I_{3}^{-}$

**Reactions in Equilibrium**

$X_{(l)} \rightleftharpoons X_{(g)}$

$2H_{2}O_{l} \rightleftharpoons H_{3}O^{+}_{aq} + OH^{-}_{aq}$


##Example: Adding Images

`![Caption of Photo](name of file)` 

Follow this format without the ` ` and make sure the image is in the same folder as your .rmd file to which you are trying to add the image. 


##Now for some R code Examples
 
R code is written in gray chunks, which start with ```{r} and end with ``` (see below)

Comments can be added to the code by adding a # in front of text

```{r}
x <- 10 + 5 # x is the number 15

print(x) #this function prints what x is

x <- as.numeric(c("1", "2", "X")) # Code that gives a warning. It converts X to NA and is warning that this is what is happening

pkg <- c("dplyr", "knitr", "xtable", "rmarkdown", "readr", "ggplot2")

new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

if (length(new.pkg)) {

  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
  
}

library(dplyr) # Code that produces messages
library(xtable)
```
 We can choose not to show messages from the code in the pdf by adding messages = FALSE to the beginning of the chunk ```{r, message = FALSE} (see below)
 
```{r, message=FALSE}
x <- 10 + 5 # x is the number 15

print(x) #this function prints what x is

x <- as.numeric(c("1", "2", "X")) # Code that gives a warning. It converts X to NA and is warning that this is what is happening

pkg <- c("dplyr", "knitr", "xtable", "rmarkdown", "readr", "ggplot2")

new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

if (length(new.pkg)) {

  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
  
}

library(dplyr) # Code that produces messages
```
 
We can control whether or not the code is shown in the pdf by adding echo = FALSE to the beginning of the chunk ```{r, echo = FALSE} (see below)

```{r, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
x <- 10 + 5 # x is the number 15

print(x) #this function prints what x is

x <- as.numeric(c("1", "2", "X")) # Code that gives a warning. 
# It converts X to NA and is warning that this is what is happening

pkg <- c("dplyr", "knitr", "xtable", "rmarkdown", "readr", "ggplot2")

new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

if (length(new.pkg)) {

  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
  
}

library(dplyr) # Code that produces messages
```

We can choose not to show warnings from the code in the pdf by adding warning = FALSE to the beginning of the chunk ```{r, warning = FALSE} (see below)

```{r, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
x <- 10 + 5 # x is the number 15

print(x) #this function prints what x is

x <- as.numeric(c("1", "2", "X")) # Code that gives a warning. It 
# converts X to NA and is warning that this is what is happening

pkg <- c("dplyr", "knitr", "xtable", "rmarkdown", "readr", "ggplot2")

new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]

if (length(new.pkg)) {

  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
  
}

library(dplyr) # Code that produces messages
```

The % symbol in LaTex is used for comments. When writing r code (only gray chunks) either avoid using the percent symbol (in captions for tables and such) or use \\%. 
If when trying to knit to pdf you get an error message in red that reads, ! File ended while scanning use of \textbf, then you have used the percent symbol somewhere in the file where it is being read as a comment in LaTex. To fix the error, try either removing % symbols from r code or using \\%. 

## Example: Creating Plots in R


```{r} 
# Add caption title within quotes above 

#Defining values for x and y to plot
x <- c(1, 2.2, 4, 6.3, 8.1) 
y <- c(5, 7.2, 8.4, 9.5, 12.3)

#Basic plot of y vs x (2 options)

plot(x, y)

#or

plot(y ~ x)

# The data look pretty linear, so let's fit a straight line (y = mx + b) to it 
# and plot with the best fit line

# First, let's put x and y values into a dataframe, much like columns in excel
x.and.y <- data_frame(x, y) 

# Take a look at the data frame by typing the name for the data frame
x.and.y


# Let's fit the data to our equation y = mx + b
fit <- nls(y ~ m*x + b, data = x.and.y, start = list(m = 1, b = 4)) # put in 
# very rough guesses for slope (m) and y intercept (b)

# Now for every x value we have we want the y values that the equation 
# predicts in order to plot the best fit line. We can extract these as a 
# vector by using the function as.vector() and the function fitted().
ycalc <- as.vector(fitted(fit))

# Now let's plot our data with the best fit line using the function lines()
plot(x, y)
lines(x, ycalc)

# To produce a plot with colored lines and solid black dots use this
plot(x, y,
     pch = 20)
lines(x, ycalc, col = "blue")

```

**Adding Axis Labels and Captions with Superscripts and Subscripts)** 

Now let's reassign x to be concentration of persulfate and y to be rate when varying persulfate concentration 
```{r, fig.cap= "Plot of Rate vs Persulfate Concentration"} 
# Add caption title within quotes above 

# reassigning x and y 
rate <- y
persulfate.conc <- x
fitted.rate <- ycalc

# Plot of rate vs persulfate concentration with appropriate labels that include units
# Within expression function, ~ is for a space while * is for no space, [] is for 
# subscript, ^ is for superscript 

plot(persulfate.conc, rate,
    xlab = expression("[" ~ S[2] * O[8]^"2-" ~ "]"  ~ (M)),   
    ylab = expression("Rate" ~ ("M" * s^-1)),
     pch = 20)
lines(persulfate.conc, fitted.rate, col = "green")
```



## Example: Creating Tables

```{r nice_table2, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
# Making a dataframe with newly named x and y values
rate.and.conc <- data_frame(rate, persulfate.conc) 

# Renaming column names for the table
rate.and.conc <- rename(rate.and.conc, "Rate (M/s)" = rate, "Persulfate Concentration (M)" = persulfate.conc)



bold_all_col_names <- function(x) {paste('\\textbf{', x, '}', sep ='')} # function to bold column names

title <- 'Rate and Persulfate Concentration' # Giving the table a title

print(xtable(rate.and.conc,   #This is the data frame you're going to use for the table 
             caption = title,  # set the caption to be the specified title above
             align = "|r|r|r|",  # right align all columns and create vertical lines, need one more |r|                                     than total columns.  Use l or c for left or center aligned
             digits = c(0, 1, 2),             # number of decimal places for each column
             display = c("d", "f", "f") # This is the type of number you want.  Like in excel where you can display it scientifically (E), as an integer (d), or as a number (f), or changing a number into an obect (s).  The first letter corresponds to an unseen row number.  It must stay there but can be ignored. 
             ), 
      caption.placement = 'top',  
      hline.after = seq(-1, nrow(rate.and.conc)),  # Horizontal lines on top through bottom of table, must match datframe name, here rate.and.conc
      include.rownames = FALSE, 
      comment = FALSE, 
      caption.width = '2.7in', 
      sanitize.colnames.function = bold_all_col_names
      )


```
