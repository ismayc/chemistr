## Data


```{r, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
#Molar Absorptivity Calculation using a 1-point calibration.  This can be done by hand in your worksheet or via R. Your choice.

Blue_Stock <-  #Report the concentration of blue dye in your stock solution.

Blue_Resistance <-  #Report the resistance of the stock blue dye.

Water_Resistance <- #Report the resistance of a water sample taken right before the blue dye.

Tran_Stock <-   #Calculate the transmittance of the stock blue dye.  Hint: remember that photons are proportional to 1/resistance.
  
Abs_Stock <-  #Calculate the absorbance of the stock blue dye.  Hint log is log10() in R
  

Molar_Absorptivity_Constant <-  #Calculate the molar absorptivity constant using Beer's Law - Absorbance = Molar Absorptivity Constant* Path Length * Concentration.
  
Calibration <- data.frame(Blue_Stock, Abs_Stock, Molar_Absorptivity_Constant)

#Run your chunk and record the results in question #1 of the worksheet.

```{r}
#Trial #1 Data.  You'll need to copy and past this chunk for each trial.  Make sure you change the variable names to reflect the trial number.

time_1 <- c() #Input the time in seconds for all the values you collected.  You should have collected from ~30-180 seconds, at 10 second intervals.

water_1 <-  #Input the resistance for the water blank you measured at the start of your trial.
  
resistance_1 <- c() #Input the resistance values you recorded for the varying time points.

Abs_1 <-  #Calculate the absorbance at each time point based upon the resistance of the blue dye and the resistance of the water sample.
  
Con_1 <-  #calculate the concentration of blue dye based upon your experimentally determined molar absorptivity value.  Remember Beer's Law: Absorbance = Molar Absorptivity * Pathlength * Concentration.  This code can be used to answer question #3.

T_1 <- data.frame(Abs_1, Con_1, time_1)

T_1 <- subset(T_1, time_1 <= 100) #Limit the graphed values by using this code. In this code only the data which has time less than or equal to 100 seconds will be used.  Choose the first time at which the next resistance value has not changed or goes up.  If it changes throughout the data collection there is no need for this code.

# Here is a R chunk where you will create a graph with your kinetics data. Note: ln (natural log) in R is log().  You'll need to copy and paste this chunk for each trial.  Make sure you change the variable names to reflect the trial number. 

chem_scatter(data = , xvar = , yvar = , xlab = "Input Label", ylab = "Input Label", reg_line=TRUE) #This is the info for making the graph.  You will need to input your data and variables to reflect your naming system and the integrated rate law you are modeling. For example, if you are modeling a second order reaction the yvar = 1/Concentration.

summary(fit1a) #This will show the fit parameters in your document.  

#Run this chunk and record the order and R^2 value in your notebook.  Then update this chunk to reflect a different order integrated rate law.  Run again and record the new R^2 value in your notebook.  Continue through order = 0, 1, and 2.  Then complete question #4 on your worksheet with the trial #1 results.  Next, copy and paste your best fit graph into question #5.  Use the fit parameters to write your caption.
