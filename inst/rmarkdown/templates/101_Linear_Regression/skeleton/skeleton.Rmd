## EV Battery Example
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here is where you input your data for your two variables.  
Time <- c(1, 2, 4, 8) #This is the X-axis values.  The currect values should be replaced with your values.
Distance <- c(10, 100, 1000, 100000) #This is the Y-axis values.  The current values should be replaced with your values.
data <- data_frame(Time, Distance) #This is a data frame.  This links all your variables into a single table.
data #typing any named item into your space will allow you to see that variable in your output.
