## Abstract

A brief description of the purpose, procedure, and conclusions.

## Leaf Sample

Description of leaf sample.  May be helpful to include a picture of the leaf used.

## Results

Text that describes both your observations as well as commentary on your chromatograms and spectroscopy results.  Figures should be included of the chromatograms and the spectra collected.  Each figure should have a complete caption.  Look at Iron_Analysis markdown file on how to include a pcture with a caption in your report.

## Discussion

Analysis of your results.  See page 8.10 in your lab manual for more detailed information on what this section should include.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here is where you input your chromatography data that you want to put into a table.  There should be more than 4 pieces of data.  Make sure as you add another line, you add all components of that piece of data:  Chromatogram, Rf, Color, and ID.
Chromatogram <- c("Green+Acid", "Green", "Red", "Red+Acid")
Rf <- c(0, 0.4, 0.8, 1)
Color <- c("Green", "Blue", "Red", "Yellow")
ID <- c("Chlorophyll A", "Chlorophyll B", "Carotenoid", "Anthocyanin")
# Place the columns next to each other in a data frame
Green <- data.frame(Chromatogram, Rf, Color, ID)
Green <- rename(Green,"Chromatogram Type" = Chromatogram,
                "Retention Factor, Rf" = Rf, 
                "Color of pigment band" = Color, 
                "Identification of pigment band" = ID)
```

```{r nice_table1, results = 'asis', echo=FALSE}
#Here is where you create a table describing all your chromatogram bands.  This will include their identities and Rf values.  
chem_table(Green, caption = "Insert caption")
```
