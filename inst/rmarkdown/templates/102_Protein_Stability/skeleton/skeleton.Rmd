##Results


```{r, echo=FALSE, results = 'asis'}
#Create a table of the results for investigating potential denaturants.  In the caption include the constant conditions in all the reactions such as temperature, concentration phycocyanin, pathlength, and wavelength measured.
Denaturant <- c("Buffer", "Urea", "Guanadinium", "Sucrose", "Ethanol", "SDS", "Acetone") #Identity of denaturants
Concentration <- c()               #Final concentration of denaturant in your reaction
Absorbance <- c()      #Absorbance at 620 nm
Fraction_Folded <-      #Calculate the fraction of protein folded.  Use the protein in buffer as 100% folded.  Remember to change to the correct number of sig figs when in Word. 
T_1 <- data.frame(Denaturant, Concentration, Absorbance, Fraction_Folded)
chem_table(T_1, caption="Table 1: Input Caption")
```


```{r, echo=TRUE, results = 'asis'}
#Create a table of the results for calculating Gibbs Free Energy with a single denaturant at a constant temperature.  In the caption include the constant conditions in all the reactions such as denaturant used, concentration phycocyanin, pathlength, wavelength measured, and temperature.
Denaturant_Concentration <- c() #Concentration of denaturant used in the reactions
Absorbance_3 <- c()      #Absorbance at 620 nm
Fraction_Folded_3 <-    #Calculate the fraction of protein folded.  Use the no denaturant as 100% folded.  Watch sig figs.
d_G_1 <-  #Calculate dG of folding based upon Equation 2 in the instructions
T_3 <- data.frame(Denaturant_Concentration, Absorbance_3, Fraction_Folded_3, d_G_1)
chem_table(T_3, caption="Table 2: Input Caption")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Input Caption"}
#Create a graph to determine the Gibbs Free Energy of folding in the native state based upon Equation 3 in the instructions.  Only include Gibbs values that are significantly above and below the 100% folded and unfolded state (consult an instructor on this if you are unsure). Make sure you include the  y-intercept, slope, and R^2 value in the caption.
newdata <- subset(T_3, Denaturant_Concentration >= 0.5 & Denaturant_Concentration <= 5, select=c(Denaturant_Concentration, d_G_1))  #This code will allow you to only select a subset of your values in Table 2.  This is important in making sure you are significantly above 0% and below 100% folded.
chem_scatter(newdata, Denaturant_Concentration, d_G_1, xlab = "Insert Label", ylab= "Insert Label")
fit1 <- lm(d_G_1 ~ Denaturant_Concentration, data = newdata) #remember to view the values from this, you must type summary(fit1) into the console.


```


```{r, include=FALSE}
#Repeat the above two steps to determine the dG in the native state for multiple temperatures.  This data does not need to be shown in the final report, but will be needed for graphing and calculating the enthalpy and entropy of folding in the next section.

#Example: data for T = 40C
Denaturant_Concentration <- c() 
Absorbance_4 <- c()     
Fraction_Folded_4 <-      
d_G_2 <- -
T_4 <- data.frame(Denaturant_Concentration, Absorbance_4, Fraction_Folded_4, d_G_2)
chem_table(T_4, caption="Table 2: Input Caption")
newdata_2 <- subset(T_4, Denaturant_Concentration >= 0.5 & Denaturant_Concentration <= 1.75, select=c(Denaturant_Concentration, d_G_2))  
chem_scatter(newdata_2, Denaturant_Concentration, d_G_2, xlab = "Label", ylab= "Label") #Since this chunk is not going into the final report, it won't appear below this chunk when your run the code.  To view the plot or fit data, you can copy and paste these values into the console and the graph will appear in the plots window.
fit2 <- lm(d_G_2 ~ Denaturant_Concentration, data = newdata_2)


```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Input Caption"}
#Use equation 4 in the instructions to create a graph that will determine the entropy and enthalpy of folding.  Make sure to include the slope (+/- uncertainty) and the intercept (+/- uncertainty) in the caption.

T <- c() #Temperature of Reactions (in K)
dG <- c() #dG native values from above Y-intercepts of Equation 3 in the instructions
T_5 <- data.frame(T, dG)
chem_scatter() #Fill out the graphing command with variables, etc. See examples above.
fit5 <- lm() #Fill out the fit parameters command with variable, etc.  See examples above.

```

##Discussion

`r #Provide an evidence based discussion of your results.  Some things to think about: 1.  Remind the reader about the purpose of the lab (big picture).  2.  What claim can be made about the enthalpic effects in unfolding?  3.  What evidence supports this claim?  Make sure any tables and data are directly referenced and cited and it is clear how this evidence relates to the enthalopic effects (aka explain how the experiment relates to enthalpy) 4.  What claim can be made about the entropic effects in unfolding?  5.  What evidence supports this claim?  Make sure any tables and data are directly referenced and cited and it is clear how this evidence relates to the entropic effects (aka explain how the experiment relates to enthalpy).  5.  A molecular level explanation of why folding is driven either entropically or enthalpically or both.  If your results seem to not fit your understanding of the chemistry or are somehow confusing, then provide an error analysis of your results as well as a clear descirition of what you expected to see and why.  6.  Make sure to include in-text citations for any facts or understanding that came from outside references and a complete list of references at the end of the report`
