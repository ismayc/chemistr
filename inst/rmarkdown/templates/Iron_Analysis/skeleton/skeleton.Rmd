## Abstract

Here you will provide a SHORT one-paragraph summary of the experiment.  It should include the question being asked, the method of analysis, and the take home finding(s) from the experiment.

## Results

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Here is where you input your standards data that you want to graph
Iron <- c(0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20) # This should be in units of Molarity (M)
Absorbance <- c(0, 0.00316, 0.006, 0.012, .024)
iron_data <- data_frame(Iron, Absorbance)
```


```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
# Here is where you create your standard curve.  Notice that we are again fitting the data to the line Y=mX+0.  In order to get the slope of your fit line, run all previous chunks and this chunk.  The summary(fit1) will give you the slope of your standard curve (Iron Estimate) as well as your uncertainty (Std. Error, NOT Residual Standard error) in the coefficients section of the summary.  Include the molar absorptivity (with units) in your caption.
chem_scatter(data = iron_data, xvar = Iron, yvar = Absorbance, 
             xlab = "New Iron Label",
             ylab = "New Absorbance Label",
             intercept = 0)
fit1 <- lm(Absorbance ~ Iron + 0, data = iron_data)
summary(fit1)
```



## Calculations

Here is where you put in either your calculations, using equations or inserting a picture of your calculations. 

Calculations to include:

1.  Concentration of Iron in final sample dilution (using standard curve equation)

2.  Amount of Iron in Tablet (in mg/tablet), accounting for dilutions done in processing the sample.

3.  Calculation of Average Iron in Tablet for Class

4.  Calculation of Standard Deviation in Tablet for Class

5.  Calculation of 90% Confidence Interval in Tablet for Class


For a good source of writing mathematical equation symbols, see <http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/LaTeX_symbols.pdf>

Example:
$5M*5L=5 \text{ moles } Fe$

Example of writing an equation or molecular formula $H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow H_2CO_3$

A figure can be inserted by using the following format, so long as the picture is saved in the same folder as the RMarkdown file.  NOTE:  You don't have the picture named below, so this RMarkdown file might not knit until you either delete line 66-68 or change the picture to be a picture in your RMarkdown folder.


```{r image, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Insert Caption"}
