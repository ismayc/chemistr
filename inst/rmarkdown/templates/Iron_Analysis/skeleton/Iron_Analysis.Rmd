##Abstract

Here you will provide a one-paragraph summary of the experiment.

##Methods

See apendix 5A for a sample for what the methods section of your lab report should look like.

##Results

The results section should include text describing your results and any figures or tables that you might like to include.  I have included example code for including two tables and a scatter plot as part of your results section. You may or may not want all of these.  

##Discussion

See appendix 3C and page 5.2 for information on how to write your discussion.

Example of writing an equation or molecular formula $H_2O + CO_2 \rightarrow H_2CO_3$

##Calculation

Here is where you put in either your calculations, using equations or inserting a picture of your calcualtions.  

For a good source of writing mathematical equation symbols, see http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/LaTeX_symbols.pdf
Example:
$5M*5L=5 moles Fe$

A figure can be inserted by using the following format, so long as the picture is saved in the same folder as the Rmarkdown file.  NOTE:  You don't have the picture named below, so this markdown file won't knit to PDF until you either delete line 70 or change the picture to be a picture in your markdown folder.
